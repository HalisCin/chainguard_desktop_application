This project is the desktop application of the blockchain-based disaster management system ChainGuard project. The main purpose of this project is to ensure the security and transparency of aid distribution processes after the disaster. To achieve this, blockchain technology was used. This project posted here is the codes of the desktop version of the Chainguard project.

The desktop application was developed for 2 different users: Admin and Supplier. 

Admin can perform a total of 3 operations: user operations, box operations and QR code generation. In user operations, new users can be added and deleted. In box operations, new boxes can be added and deleted. On the other hand,supplier can only generate QR codes for the boxes through this application. After entering the size, content, type and weight of the box, a QR code is generated. The supplier then prints these QR codes, pastes them on the boxes and makes them ready for shipment.

The packages which are ready for shipment, are scanned by the drivers.Then driver use the QR code scanning feature that we developed in our mobile application and the packages are placed on the driver.Then, when the packages for distribution arrive at their destination, local officials scan the QR code again and place the boxes on themselves, and the packages are ready for distribution to users. 

Below you can see the user interfaces that I developed for admin and supplier.
